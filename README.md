# Data structures and algorithms

Various data structures and algorithms implemented in C and Java.

Submitted as coursework in my first year at the University of Bath.

I particularly enjoyed implementing the XOR linked list and transposition cipher :) 

Assignment specifics can be found in [Specification.pdf](./Specification.pdf).
